SET'n'3270: The Mainframe TN3270 Social Engineering Tool. This tool can be
used in three ways: 1) Create a fake TSO logon screen as a honey pot. 2)
Mirror a live mainframe, even taking commands you expect users to enter. 3)
MITM a connection and output the input to the console.

                        Typed commands you want to send/expect to receive.
                        Multiple commands can be seperated by a semi-colon
                        ';'. e.g: ./SETn3270.py target.com --commands
                        "logon;netview;tso"

                        Note: Most tn3270 clients don't make it easy to change
                        ports so don't expect your targets to do so
  --nossl               Disable server side SSL. Note: Most clients will fail
                        if you do not have SSL enabled when they expect SSL
                        connections.
